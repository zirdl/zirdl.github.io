<p><img src="/imgs/Untitled.jpg" alt="Poster" /> 
The Netflix Docudramaâ€”<a href="https://www.netflix.com/ph-en/title/81254224">The Social Dilemma</a> explores social media's flaws and harmful effects directed not just to our health, but also to our freedom and democracy. <strong>The Social Dilemma</strong> serves as a wake-up call, urging viewers to critically evaluate their relationship with social media and consider the broader implications of its widespread use. By exposing the flaws and harmful effects of these platforms, the documentary aims to spark conversations and encourage individuals, policymakers, and tech companies to address the ethical and societal challenges associated with social media.</p>
<p>As we navigate the intricate landscape of social media, it becomes crucial to understand why we cannot blindly trust it while also acknowledging the challenges posed by completely quitting its use.</p>
<p>We can visit <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">their website at thesocialdilemma.com</a> to learn more, and take action regarding the matter.</p>
<h2 id="we-cannot-trust-social-media">We Cannot Trust Social Media</h2>
<p>Have you ever read the <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong> of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or maybe Threads before ticking that check box and clicking the <em><strong>Sign up</strong></em> button? Did you know that Meta (formerly Facebook) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation">collects all your activities from their products?</a> Meta, on their Privacy Policy page states that they're using your data to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?annotations%5B0%5D=1.story.3-WhatWeCollectFrom&amp;subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation">improve various features of their products such as filters and the quality of voice recordings,</a> they're also using your data to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads">show you advertisements</a> based from your activities on and off their platforms. Meta <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?subpage=2.subpage.2-HowWeShowAds">wants everything their users see to be interesting and useful to them</a>.</strong>  In Layman's terms, they're using your precious data to leverage profit; <strong>their entire business model runs on analyzing user data for targeted advertisements.</strong></p>
<p><br><center>
<img src="/imgs/fbook.png" alt="fbook" /></center></p>
<p>Social media platforms have mastered the art of capturing our attention and shaping our behaviors. By employing sophisticated algorithms, they curate personalized content, often prioritizing sensational or divisive information. This algorithmic bias can create echo chambers and filter bubbles, presenting users with a distorted reality that reinforces their existing beliefs. As a result, we become susceptible to manipulation, hindering our ability to form well-rounded perspectives.</p>
<p>But users, have the option to <em><strong>&quot;take control&quot;</strong></em> over what they let companies to collect, does this mean that your data is now out of reach?. For example, users can turn-off personalized ads on Facebook (but users will still see ads on other platforms connected with their Facebook account), but that doesn't mean that they get to see no ads, this just means that Meta won't show their users what they call <em><strong>&quot;useful&quot;</strong></em> ads, users will still get their fair share of advertisements. The former is just one of the many instances on how Meta, and probably any other social media platform that has the same business model, manipulates its users onto thinking that they are the one in-control of their data. Users <strong>can only take control of an app's permissions</strong> on how it handles data from a user's device, apart from that, <strong>everything is explicit</strong>.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg on why we cannot trust social media with our data. Meta, Facebook parent, has faced <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/facebooks-2019-fines-and-settlements.html">numerous lawsuits throughout its inception</a>, spending millions of dollars on paying settlement fines. The most prominent one is probably the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica Scandal</a>, but recently, a new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/b68f2951-2a4b-4822-b0fb-04238703c039.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">lawsuit</a> by 41 states (in the U.S.) against Meta, was filed claiming that Facebook and Instagram exploits young users, through its algorithm, for profit and that these platforms poses serious health concerns to the young users.</p>
<h2 id="but-neither-can-we-quit-using-it">But Neither Can We Quit Using It</h2>
<p>Despite those aforementioned facts on the flaws of social media, we cannot also deny the fact that it [social media] has become interwined with our lives. A <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127983/philippines-leading-social-media-platforms/">research from statista.com</a> shows that Facebook, in the Philippines, still rules as the top social media platform, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1219918/philippines-sources-of-news-by-channel/">primary source of news</a>, and a ground for e-commerce companies to reach their consumers. <strong>Like the Telegraph, Print Media, Radio and Television, Social Media shaped how we communicate and connect interpersonally</strong>.

<p>We don't want to be missed-out from societal norms, and social media is a huge part of that norm. The <strong>fear of missing out (FOMO)</strong> on social interactions, events, and updates from friends and acquaintances is one of the factors why users are hesitant to quit social media. Social media platforms offer a convenient and instantaneous way to stay connected with others, making it difficult for individuals to sever these virtual ties. According to a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325452848_The_theory_of_planned_behaviour_and_user_engagement_applied_to_Facebook_advertising#read">study</a> conducted by Dhir, Pallesen, and Torsheim (2016), FOMO significantly predicts social media engagement, indicating its influence on users' <strong>reluctance to quit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/influencing.png" alt="influence" /> </p>
<p>On the psychological side of things, social media platforms provide a sense of validation through likes, comments, and online interactions, which can lead to emotional gratification. The constant stream of updates, notifications, and feedback triggers dopamine release in the brain, contributing to addictive behaviors. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369147/">research article</a> by Kuss and Griffiths (2017) explores the <strong>psychological gratification derived from social media use</strong>, highlighting the challenges individuals face when attempting to quit.</p>
<p>Social media also has become a major source of news, entertainment, and information in the digital age. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram offer quick access to real-time updates, trending topics, and viral content. Quitting social media can result in a perceived loss of valuable information and entertainment. An <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266164688_Social_Media_in_the_Changing_Ecology_of_News_The_Fourth_and_Fifth_Estate_in_Britain#read">article</a> by Newman, Dutton, and Blank (2019) discusses the role of social media in news consumption and its impact on information behavior, shedding light on the difficulties associated with giving up these platforms.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-fix-it-then">How Can We Fix it Then?</h2>
<p>Fixing social media requires a holistic approach that addresses various aspects of its design, impact, and regulation. First and foremost, increased transparency and accountability are crucial. Social media platforms should be transparent about their algorithms, content moderation practices, and data collection methods. This transparency would enable users to better understand how their data is used and empower them to make informed choices about their online interactions. Additionally, establishing clear guidelines and standards for responsible content curation and moderation can help combat the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>collaboration among stakeholders is essential</strong>. Governments, tech companies, researchers, and civil society organizations <strong>should work together</strong> to develop and implement regulations and policies that protect user privacy, promote digital literacy, and ensure ethical practices by social media platforms. This collaboration can also involve supporting independent fact-checking organizations, open-source projects, and promoting media literacy to equip users with the skills to critically evaluate information. Additionally, empowering users through customizable privacy settings, intuitive user interfaces, and easy-to-access tools for managing screen time and well-being can help individuals take control of their social media experiences. Ultimately, fostering a culture of responsible digital citizenship and promoting empathy, respect, and healthy online interactions will contribute to a more positive and constructive social media environment.</p>
